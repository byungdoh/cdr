DTSR Package API
================

Most users will only need to interface with DTSR using config files and predefined DTSR executables as described in :ref:`getting_started`.
However, advanced users may want to write code using DTSR instances, create additional DTSR subclasses, or query the DTSR model in ways not supported by existing executables.
This API reference is designed to support these kinds of cases.
