CDR Package API
================

Most users will only need to interface with CDR using config files and predefined CDR executables as described in :ref:`getting_started`.
However, advanced users may want to write code using CDR instances, create additional CDR subclasses, or query the CDR model in ways not supported by existing executables.
This API reference is designed to support these kinds of cases.
